# Exploratory Data Analysis of Data Science Salaries
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook detailing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of data science salaries. The dataset, 'salaries.csv', provides insights into various attributes of data science job roles and their corresponding salaries.

## Overview

The aim of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the data science job market. Through this EDA, we offer insights into trends, distributions, and other valuable information about data science salaries.

## Key Features
* Utilized **Python** to analyze 4000 data science job salaries and gain insights on any significant trends in the job market in the data science field.
* Employed **country_converter** to standardize country names in the dataset.
* Crafted insightful visualizations using **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly** to compile a professional report.
* Analyzed and interpreted data visualizations to draw meaningful insights about the data science job market.

Detailed analysis and interpretation of visualizations, offering meaningful insights and takeaways about the data science job landscape.
